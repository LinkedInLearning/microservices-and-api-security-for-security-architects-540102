## Course Description

<p>In this course, delve into the critical aspects of securing distributed applications. Instructor Karl Ots shows you how to safeguard APIs through robust gateway protection and secure microservices within containerized environments with service mesh architecture. Along the way, gain the skills necessary to design and deploy secure, scalable architectures that meet your organization’s security requirements. This course is designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of security measures without focusing on specific vendor configurations.</p><p>This course is integrated with GitHub Codespaces, an instant cloud development environment that offers all the functionality of your favorite IDE without the need for any local machine setup. With GitHub Codespaces, you can get hands-on practice from any machine, at any time—all while using a tool that you’ll likely encounter in the workplace.</p>

## Prerequisites and Setup
1. **Required Tools**: Before starting, ensure you have these tools installed and configured:
	- **kubectl** - Kubernetes command-line tool for cluster management
    - **helm** - Kubernetes package manager for installing applications
    - **istioctl** - Istio service mesh command-line tool
The course demos are optimized for **GitHub Codespaces**, which provides a pre-configured environment with tools like bash and az cli already installed.

2. **Kubernetes Cluster**: You'll need access to a running Kubernetes cluster. Depending on where you host your Kubernetes cluster, some adjustments may be needed.

3. **Getting Started**:
   - Clone this repository to your local machine or open it in GitHub Codespaces
   - Navigate to the specific chapter folders (e.g., `3_4 rate limiting/`, `4_4 istio/`, `5_3 kyverno/`) for each demo
   - Follow along with the course demonstration videos.
